Respect your friends' feelings and recognize everything in an open perspective. So I'm an open-minded person: I have a fairly relaxed and independent mindset in refining opinions to reach the final conclusion instead of relying on just what others say. I'm not the type to "judge a book through the cover" in any situation I believe true honesty will lead me to the right choice.

I can be a person who possesses many skills but convincing others with complete lies is not something I can do. For situations where I absolutely cannot use the truth, I always choose to not say anything silently.

One of the salient features is also my negative habit: it takes me too much effort and time to think about a problem sometimes that can lead me to a world full of frustration. Sometimes I analyze too much too deeply into a problem that makes me nervous, which sometimes leads me to no results at all.

I often have sarcastic judgments, but sometimes I don't realize it myself. But people close to me can sometimes be humiliated by their humor, which means they get too much chaos, which means that when I'm overjoyed I often don't control the irony in my sentences.
